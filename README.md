# Debug the DOM

## Overview
In this project, I was tasked to debug the fitness webpage by preventing users from adding duplicate fitness goals to the list. I wrote a function that checks if the goal being added already exists in the list before appending it. If a goal has been added the function should display an alert to inform the user if they try to add a duplicate goal.

## Tech Used
 <div align="left">
  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" height="40" alt="javascript logo"  />
</div>

## How to Test 
+ Open the index.html in a browser
+ Enter your fitness goal in the input box and an alert message will pop up if the goal entered already exists
